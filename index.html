            <p>Hi! My name is Edward Lui, and welcome to my portfolio page. I am a 20 year old future Web Developer. I am based in Melbourne, Australia, and have lived here my whole life. Some of my interests include gaming, travelling, and exercising. I decided to take this step into web development as I wanted a career change and pick up a new skill, specifically one that is future-proof, that I can enjoy learning along the way.</p>

            <h2>My Work</h2>
            <p>A lot of my work is currently a work-in-progress, so how about some memes in the meantime? (Just imagine them as placeholders for future completed work.)</p>
